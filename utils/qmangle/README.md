# QMangle

QMangle is a tool for generating problematic sentences from correct sentences.
Mangled sentences can be used to train deep learning models the wrong way of
doing something -- helpful for error detection.

It is under active development, but its functionality will be contingent upon
our internal use cases.  We encourage you to contribute to this package to make
it what you want it to be!

## Usage

Right now QMangle can generate

 - Sentences with subject verb-agreement errors from correct sentences

## Use case

At Quill.org we generate sentences with subject verb agreement errors to build
datasets that can be used to train our neural net how to detect sentences with
subject-verb agreement errors.
