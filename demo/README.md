# Demo

This directory contains a simple demo that we use to demonstrate Quill's NLP capabilities. 
The current demo is a simple Flask app with a D3 visualization. This D3 visualization groups
student answers by subject, verb and topic.

Run the demo with the following command:

> export FLASK_APP=demo.app:app ; flask run
