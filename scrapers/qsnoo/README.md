# QSnoo

We theorize that reddit has many users who police and correct the grammar of
other users on reddit. It should be possible then to find grammar suggestions
and use the problematic sentence as an example of a problem. If these
problematic sentences could be discovered and collected effectively, the dataset
could be useful for lots of internal machine learning applications. That is the
goal of QSnoo, the problematic sentence scraper from Quill.org.
