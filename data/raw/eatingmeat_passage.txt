A roasted turkey is symbolic of Thanksgiving. Hamburgers and hot dogs are traditional foods for Fourth of July barbecues. Beef chili, barbecued ribs, and southern fried chicken are all classic American foods. For some Americans, eliminating meat would be like giving up an essential part of our culture and traditions. But could the American tradition of eating meat be hurting the earth?

Raising animals and transporting meat creates almost one-fifth of the earth’s greenhouse gases. This is more than the greenhouse gases produced by cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes combined. In addition, almost half of the water used in the U.S. goes to raising livestock. 

Most of the beef produced domestically is eaten by Americans. However, exports are also increasing as more countries integrate meat into their daily diets. As a result, the meat industry is thriving. Reducing meat consumption could damage an important domestic industry, hurting the economy and taking away precious jobs.

Some people choose another option. “Flexitarians” are vegetarians who eat meat occasionally. Flexitarians believe that a diet should be mostly plant-based, but that meat and fish can be healthy and responsible choices if consumed in moderation.
